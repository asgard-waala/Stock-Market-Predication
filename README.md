# Stock Market Prediction using Python and Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock market trends using Python and machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and training a Random Forest classifier, the code can provide insights into whether the stock prices are likely to increase or decrease.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

-   Python (version 3.x)
-   `yfinance` library
-   `sklearn` library
-   `pandas` library
## Getting Started

1.  Install the required libraries by running the following command: 
		`pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas` 
    
3.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
    
4.  Open the Python script or notebook where you want to use the code.
    
5.  Import the necessary libraries:
    
    -   `yfinance` for fetching stock market data
    -   `sklearn` for implementing the Random Forest classifier
    -   `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
6.  Copy and paste the provided code into your script or notebook.
    
7.  Run the code to see the stock market predictions.
## Explanation

This project follows a step-by-step process to predict stock market trends:

1.  Retrieving Historical Stock Data:
    
    -   The `yfinance` library is used to fetch historical data for the BSE Sensex stock market index.
2.  Preparing the Data for Prediction:
    
    -   Unnecessary columns related to dividends and stock splits are removed.
    -   A target variable, "Target," is created to represent whether the stock price will increase or decrease.
3.  Training the Random Forest Classifier:
    
    -   The data is split into a training set and a test set.
    -   A Random Forest classifier is created and trained on the training data.
4.  Backtesting and Evaluation:
    
    -   The trained model is evaluated using backtesting, where predictions are made on the test set in a rolling manner.
    -   Performance metrics such as precision score are calculated to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
5.  Additional Features and Enhancements:
    
    -   Additional predictors based on different time horizons and technical indicators can be created to improve prediction accuracy.
    -   Adjustments to the prediction threshold can be made to enhance the precision of the model.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple approach to predict stock market trends using Python and machine learning. By following the steps outlined in the README, you can run the provided code and gain insights into potential stock price movements. Feel free to explore and experiment with different parameters and techniques to enhance the accuracy of the predictions.
